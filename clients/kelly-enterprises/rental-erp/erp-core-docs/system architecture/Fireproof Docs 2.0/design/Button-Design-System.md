# Button Design System

## Core Rule

Each button type has a fixed design. Only the size can change.

## How It Works

```tsx
<CloseButton size="md" />
<SaveButton size="lg" />
<DeleteButton size="sm" />
```

Each button component has its own design built in. Developers can only change the size.

## Benefits

- Every "Close" button looks identical across the platform
- Every "Save" button looks identical across the platform  
- Change the design in one place, updates everywhere
- Developers can't create inconsistent buttons
