# Design Documentation Index

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-09-05  
**Purpose:** Master index of all design system documentation for visual consistency and user experience

## Documents

### 1. Design_System_v2.0.md
**Purpose:** Comprehensive design system specification and guidelines  
**Contains:**
- Complete color palette and usage guidelines
- Typography hierarchy and font specifications
- Component library specifications
- Layout and spacing system
- Interactive states and animations
- Accessibility guidelines and standards

**Use When:**
- Building new UI components
- Understanding overall design system
- Ensuring visual consistency across application
- Implementing responsive design patterns

### 2. Visual_Style_Guide_v1.0.md
**Purpose:** Infrastructure component usage patterns and examples  
**Contains:**
- Quick reference infrastructure component patterns
- Component import and usage examples
- Infrastructure component composition patterns
- Layout patterns using infrastructure components
- Component integration best practices

**Use When:**
- Quick infrastructure component reference
- Understanding component usage patterns
- Learning component composition techniques
- Implementing layouts with infrastructure components

## Quick Reference Guide

### Need comprehensive design system reference?
→ **Design_System_v2.0.md**

### Need infrastructure component usage patterns?
→ **Visual_Style_Guide_v1.0.md**

### Need to see archived design documents?
→ Check the `archive/` subdirectory

## Document Relationships

```
Design_System_v2.0.md (comprehensive specification)
    ↓ (detailed reference)
Visual_Style_Guide_v1.0.md (infrastructure component patterns)
    ↓ (component usage)
Infrastructure Component Implementation
```

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- Start with **Design_System_v2.0.md** for complete understanding
- Use **Visual_Style_Guide_v1.0.md** for infrastructure component usage patterns

### For Designers
- **Design_System_v2.0.md** contains the authoritative design specifications
- **Visual_Style_Guide_v1.0.md** shows how designs translate to infrastructure components

### Document Overlap
Despite some content overlap between Design_System_v2.0 and Visual_Style_Guide_v1.0, they serve different purposes:
- **Design_System_v2.0**: Comprehensive reference for understanding (specifications only)
- **Visual_Style_Guide_v1.0**: Infrastructure component usage guide for implementation

## Content Focus

**Visual Consistency**: This folder ensures consistent visual implementation across the entire application through comprehensive specifications and quick-reference guides.

**Related Folders**:
- `/business/` - UI workflow specifications
- `/technical/` - Technical implementation details
- `/project/` - Project vision and migration strategy

## Maintenance Notes

- All design documents should focus on visual specifications
- Keep design system comprehensive and implementation guides practical
- Maintain cross-references between overlapping documents
- Update both documents when design system changes occur
