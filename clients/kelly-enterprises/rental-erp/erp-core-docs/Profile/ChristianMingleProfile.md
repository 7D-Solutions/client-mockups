# Christian Mingle Profile

## About Me

Faith, family, and adventure - these are the cornerstones of my life. As a devoted follower of Christ, I'm actively involved in my church and community, and I've been blessed to serve on mission trips both here at home and abroad. There's nothing quite like seeing God's work in action and being His hands and feet in the world.

I'm a proud parent of 5 wonderful children and blessed grandparent to amazing grandkids who bring endless joy to my life. Family gatherings are some of my favorite times, filled with laughter, love, and gratitude for God's abundant blessings.

## My Lifestyle

I live in the beautiful countryside where I can breathe fresh air, enjoy wide open spaces, and appreciate God's creation every day. I'm passionate about staying physically fit and active - whether I'm riding horses through scenic trails, soaking up sunshine at the beach, or exploring the great outdoors.

And yes, I love a good adrenaline rush! I'm adventurous enough to jump out of perfectly good airplanes (with a parachute, of course!). Life is too short not to embrace the thrill of new experiences and trust in God's protection.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking a partner who shares my love for Christ and understands that faith isn't just Sunday mornings - it's a daily walk. Someone who values family, enjoys an active lifestyle, and isn't afraid of a little adventure. Whether we're serving together on a mission trip, riding horses at sunset, relaxing on the beach, or simply enjoying quiet country evenings, I believe the right relationship is built on shared values, mutual respect, and a foundation in Christ.

If you're looking for someone genuine, active, and committed to living life to the fullest while keeping God at the center, let's connect!
