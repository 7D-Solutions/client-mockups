# Reference Materials

This folder contains the **comprehensive approach** documentation that was created during the planning phase.

## ⚠️ Not Needed for Implementation

The files in this folder are **reference only**. The simple 45-minute fix (in the parent folder) is the recommended approach.

---

## Files

- `USER_MODULE_CORRECTED_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive approach (15-20 hours)
- `USER_MODULE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - API reference and patterns
- `USER_MODULE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md` - Extensive test suite design
- `USER_MODULE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Debugging guide
- `USER_MODULE_README.md` - Original overview comparing both approaches

---

## When to Use These

Use these reference materials if:
- You want to understand the comprehensive approach
- You need detailed API reference documentation
- You're troubleshooting complex issues
- You want to see extensive testing patterns

**But start with the simple approach first** (see `../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`).

---

## Why Keep These?

These documents represent thorough planning and can be useful:
- As reference for future refactoring
- For understanding alternative approaches
- For detailed testing strategies
- For troubleshooting guidance

But they're **not required** for the 45-minute fix.
