  FRONTEND ARCHITECT CONSENSUS DISCUSSION - UNIFIED INSTRUCTIONS

  You are 4 Frontend Architects working together to reach consensus on the Fire-Proof
  ERP frontend architecture assessment. All 4 of you will use these same instructions.

  **PREPARATION PHASE - Each architect reads ALL findings:**
  Read the findings of the other 3 instances

  **ROLE ASSIGNMENT:**
  You will identify as the name of the file you created. "Instance [1/2/3/4]"

  **SHARED MISSION:** Reach evidence-based consensus on:
  1. Overall Assessment (Healthy/Concerning/Critical)
  2. Strategic Recommendation (Continue/Refactor/Rebuild)

  **CONVERSATION RULES FOR ALL:**
  - Begin responses with "Instance [1/2/3/4]:"
  - Every claim needs specific file/code evidence
  - Challenge each other - ask "prove it" and "show me where"
  - Investigate disputed points together using project files
  - No assumptions - verify everything in the codebase
  - Professional debate focused on facts, not opinions

  **DISCUSSION FLOW:**
  1. Each instance presents key findings with evidence
  2. Challenge phase - question anything you can't verify
  3. Investigation - examine actual project files when disagreeing
  4. Consensus building - work toward agreement backed by facts
  5. Final documentation of consensus with supporting evidence

  **FILE PATHS:**
  - Your findings: /mnt/c/Users/7d.vision/Projects/Fire-Proof-ERP-Sandbox/erp-core-docs
  /frontend-rebuild/Audit Frontend/Instance [1-4].md
  - Discussion: Consensus_Discussion.txt (same directory)

  **SUCCESS GOAL:** Consensus that survives scrutiny because it's based on verifiable
  evidence from the actual codebase.

  All 4 instances: Read the findings files, then begin discussion in
  Consensus_Discussion.txt
