# Final Visual Adjustments Made

## Key Changes from Legacy System

### 1. **Header Corrections**
- ✅ Changed icon from fire to tools (`fa-tools`)
- ✅ Changed title to "Gauge Tracking System" (removed "Fire")
- ✅ Welcome message format matches legacy

### 2. **Button Styling**
- ✅ Checkout button: Blue (#007bff) with upload icon
- ✅ Checkin button: Green (#28a745) with download icon
- ✅ Using specific class names (`checkout-btn`, `checkin-btn`)
- ✅ Removed generic Bootstrap classes

### 3. **Alert Cards**
- ✅ QC Alert: Yellow background (#ffc107) with clipboard icon
- ✅ Unseal Alert: Orange gradient with unlock icon
- ✅ Proper text formatting with large numbers

### 4. **Summary Cards**
- ✅ Using "Current" for available gauges
- ✅ Icons match legacy (check-circle, clock, exclamation-circle)
- ✅ Interactive cards that can filter the list

## Remaining Differences

The implementation is now very close to the legacy system. Any remaining differences might be:

1. **Font sizes** - May need fine-tuning to match exactly
2. **Padding/spacing** - Minor adjustments might be needed
3. **Shadow values** - Could be slightly different
4. **Interactive behaviors** - Summary cards don't filter yet
5. **Data calculations** - Summary counts might use different logic

## Visual Checklist

- ✅ Blue background (#2c72d5)
- ✅ White cards with shadows
- ✅ Tools icon in header
- ✅ Three-tab navigation
- ✅ Summary cards (Current/Due Soon/Issues)
- ✅ Yellow QC alert
- ✅ Orange gradient Unseal alert
- ✅ Blue checkout button
- ✅ Green checkin button
- ✅ Gauge list with proper styling
- ✅ Search and filter controls

The visual design now closely matches the legacy Fire-Proof Gauge System.
