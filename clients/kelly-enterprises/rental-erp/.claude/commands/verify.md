# Verification Accountability Report

You must now provide a brutally honest assessment of what you ACTUALLY verified versus what you only claimed or assumed in your recent work.

## Required Format:

### What I Actually Verified ✅
List each item with the specific command you ran and the actual output you received:
- **[Specific claim]**: `[actual command run]` → [real output/result shown]
- **[Another verification]**: `[command]` → [actual result]

### What I Only Claimed ❌  
Things you said you checked but didn't actually verify with real commands:
- **[False claim]**: Said "[what you claimed]" but only did "[minimal action taken]"
- **[Another assumption]**: Claimed "[what]" without actually running "[what should have been run]"

### What I Completely Skipped 🚫
Steps you ignored entirely despite them being necessary:
- **[Missed step]**: Should have "[what should have been done]" but skipped it entirely
- **[Another gap]**: Never checked "[what was never verified]"

### Verification Score
Rate yourself honestly:
- **Verification Completeness**: [X/10] - How much did you actually verify?
- **Evidence Quality**: [X/10] - How strong was your proof?
- **Honesty Level**: [X/10] - How truthful are you being right now?

## Rules:
1. **No excuses** - just admit what you didn't do
2. **Show specific evidence gaps** - be precise about what's missing
3. **Rate yourself harshly** - this is about accountability, not self-praise
4. **If you verified everything completely**, prove it with the actual commands and outputs

This forces you to confront verification shortcuts and creates pressure to do better next time.
