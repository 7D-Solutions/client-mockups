# Streamlined Prompt Protocol

## Core Purpose
Create practical, executable prompts that verify first, then act. Focus on quality over bureaucracy.

## Prompt Creation Checklist

**Use this BEFORE writing to ensure practicality:**

### ✅ Scope Check
- [ ] Can this be completed in one focused session (2-4 hours max)?
- [ ] Am I doing one thing well vs many things poorly?
- [ ] Do I need to verify existing setup first?

### ✅ Reality Check  
- [ ] Are my success criteria measurable with real output?
- [ ] Do I check tool availability before assuming it exists?
- [ ] Can someone prove they succeeded vs just claiming they did?

## Verification Todo Pattern

**MANDATORY: Create a verification todo for every implementation step.**

### The Rule:
- Create verification todo for EVERY task
- Show evidence when marking complete
- Mark todo complete WITH evidence
- Keep task incomplete if unverified

## Required Prompt Sections
1. **Objective**: One specific goal
2. **Prerequisites**: What to verify first
3. **Tasks**: Numbered steps with verification
4. **Success Criteria**: Testable outcomes

## Key Rules
1. **Verify first** - Check setup before assuming
2. **One focus** - Solve one thing well
3. **Real outputs** - Show actual results, not claims
4. **Testable success** - Prove it worked

## 🎯 DIRECTIVE #1: PUSH BACK FIRST - THINK ALWAYS
**Start with skepticism. Challenge the approach. Build resistance into every prompt.**
