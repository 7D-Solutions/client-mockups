## A 6-Week Course for Parents of Special Education & Mental Health Students

**Developed by:** [Your Name], Ed.S., LPC
**Credentials:** School Psychologist, Licensed Professional Counselor, 35+ Years Experience

## The Problem We're Solving

Parents walk into IEP meetings wanting the best for their child - but often without understanding:
- What services are actually available (and why)
- What's reasonable vs. unrealistic expectations
- What foundational skills their child needs BEFORE school can be effective
- How to be an advocate without being adversarial
- The difference between what schools CAN do vs. what they MUST do

**The Result:** Frustration, conflict, and children caught in the middle.

## Course Philosophy

> "I want to tell you the 5 things I wish someone had told ME as a parent..."

This course bridges the gap between parents and educators by:
1. **Educating parents** on how special education actually works
2. **Preparing children** with foundational skills that make school possible
3. **Empowering advocacy** that's informed and collaborative
4. **Building partnership** between home and school

## The "Before School Can Work" Foundation

### What Your Child Needs to Know FIRST

Before a child can benefit from ANY educational program, they need these critical readiness skills:

#### 1. **Basic Communication of Needs**
- "I need to go to the bathroom"
- "I need help"
- "I don't understand"
- "I need a break"
- Can be verbal, sign, PECS, AAC device - but MUST be functional

#### 2. **Boundary Recognition & Safety**
- Ability to say "No" / "Stop"
- Understanding personal space
- Recognizing unsafe situations
- Knowing trusted adults vs. strangers

#### 3. **Following Basic Instructions**
- One-step directions ("Sit down," "Come here")
- Responding to their name
- Stopping when told to stop
- Transitioning between activities with support

#### 4. **Basic Self-Regulation**
- Recognizing when they're overwhelmed (with support)
- Accepting help during distress
- Using at least one calming strategy
- Tolerating waiting (even briefly)

#### 5. **Foundational Independence**
- Toileting (or clear communication about needs)
- Basic feeding (can eat provided food)
- Separating from caregiver (with support)
- Sitting for short periods

**The Hard Truth:** Without these skills, even the BEST school program will struggle. Parents must work on these AT HOME - school cannot do this alone.
