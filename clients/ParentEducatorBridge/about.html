                <h2>Hello, I'm Shannon Andrews</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>School Psychologist, Licensed Professional Counselor & Special Education Director</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My career in special education began in the classroom, where I spent a decade working with children from pre-K through sixth grade. Those early years taught me that every child learns differently, and the key to success lies in understanding each child's unique strengths and challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While teaching, I also worked with Oklahoma's SoonerStart program, providing early intervention services to infants and toddlers with developmental delays in their homes. This experience showed me how crucial those first three years are, and how much parents need support and guidance during this formative time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Driven to deepen my understanding of child development and behavior, I pursued certification as a School Psychologist. I've served school districts across Oklahoma, Oregon, and Texas, conducting comprehensive evaluations, developing behavior management programs, and providing counseling to students and families.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a Licensed Professional Counselor, I've also provided therapy services to individuals, groups, and families outside the school setting—helping parents navigate the challenges of raising children with special needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I serve as both Special Education Director and School Psychologist. But my greatest passion is sharing what I've learned with parents like you—the strategies, insights, and practical tools that make a real difference in children's lives.
