## The Hard Truth

I've sat in hundreds of IEP meetings. I've seen parents fight for more hours, more support, more services. And I understand - you want the BEST for your child.

But here's what I wish someone had told me:

**No amount of school services can replace the foundational skills your child must learn at HOME.**

These 5 skills are non-negotiable. Without them, even the most amazing teacher with the most resources will struggle to help your child learn.

## Skill #1: Basic Communication of Needs

### Why It Matters
If your child can't tell an adult they need to use the bathroom, they will have accidents. If they can't say "I need help," they will become frustrated. If they can't express "I need a break," they will melt down.

**This is THE most critical skill.**

### What This Looks Like
Your child can communicate (in ANY form):
- [ ] "I need to go to the bathroom" / "Potty"
- [ ] "I need help" / "Help me"
- [ ] "I don't understand"
- [ ] "I want ___" (basic requests)
- [ ] "I'm done" / "All done"
- [ ] "I need a break"

### How to Teach It

**Step 1: Choose the Method**
- Verbal words
- Sign language (start with 5-10 signs)
- Picture Exchange (PECS)
- AAC device or app
- Simple gestures

**Step 2: Create Opportunities**
Don't anticipate every need. Wait. Let them experience the need, then prompt the communication.

**Step 3: Practice Relentlessly**
- 10+ practice opportunities per day
- Prompt → Response → Immediate reward
- Gradually fade prompts

**Step 4: Generalize**
Practice with different people, in different locations, at different times.

### Practice Script: Teaching "Bathroom"
1. Watch for signs your child needs to go
2. BEFORE taking them, prompt: "Say 'potty'" (or show picture/sign)
3. Wait 3-5 seconds
4. If they attempt, celebrate and GO IMMEDIATELY
5. If no response, model and assist, then go
6. Repeat every single time

**Timeline:** This may take weeks or months. Do not give up.

## Skill #2: Boundaries & Saying "No"

### Why It Matters
Children with disabilities are at higher risk for abuse. Your child MUST be able to:
- Refuse something they don't want
- Express discomfort
- Identify safe vs. unsafe people
- Protect their body

### What This Looks Like
- [ ] Can say/sign/indicate "No" or "Stop"
- [ ] Pushes away unwanted items or touch
- [ ] Shows discomfort with unfamiliar people
- [ ] Can identify 3-5 "safe" trusted adults
- [ ] Understands basic body boundaries

### How to Teach It

**Make "No" Powerful**
- When your child says "no" - HONOR IT (when safe to do so)
- Offer choices so "no" has meaning
- Practice in play: "Do you want the red one?" "No!" "Okay, you said no!"

**Teach "Stop"**
- Tickle games: "Say STOP when you want me to stop" → immediately stop
- Chase games: "STOP" means freeze
- Show them their words have POWER

**Safe People Practice**
- Create a photo board of safe people
- Review regularly: "Who can help you?"
- Practice: "If you're lost, find a [store worker/police officer]"

**Body Boundaries**
- Teach proper names for body parts
- "Your body belongs to YOU"
- Practice: "No one touches your private parts except doctors with mom/dad there"

### Red Flags to Address
- Child is overly compliant with all adults
- Child doesn't resist unwanted touch
- Child can't identify any trusted adults
- Child has no way to express "no"

## Skill #3: Following Basic Instructions

### Why It Matters
In a classroom, a child must respond to their name, follow simple directions, and transition between activities. Without this, they cannot access instruction.

### What This Looks Like
- [ ] Responds to their name (looks, comes, or acknowledges)
- [ ] Follows one-step directions: "Sit down," "Come here," "Give me the ___"
- [ ] Stops when told "Stop" or "Wait"
- [ ] Can transition from one activity to another (with support)
- [ ] Can sit in a designated spot for at least 2-3 minutes

### How to Teach It

**Start Simple**
- One word commands: "Sit." "Come." "Stop."
- Always in the same tone, same word
- Immediate follow-through (guide them if needed)
- Immediate reward for compliance

**The 3-Second Rule**
- Give direction
- Wait 3 seconds
- If no response, physically guide
- Then reward

**Never Give a Direction You Can't Enforce**
If you say "Come here" and they don't come, you MUST follow through. Don't give directions you can't enforce in that moment.

**Transition Practice**
- Use visual timers
- "First ___, then ___"
- Warn before transitions: "2 more minutes, then we clean up"
- Practice at home before expecting it at school

## Skill #4: Basic Self-Regulation

### Why It Matters
Meltdowns happen. But your child needs to:
- Start recognizing when they're becoming overwhelmed
- Accept help from adults during distress
- Have at least ONE calming strategy
- Recover after being upset

### What This Looks Like
- [ ] Shows early warning signs of overwhelm (that adults can read)
- [ ] Will accept comfort/help when upset (doesn't push everyone away)
- [ ] Can use at least one calming strategy with prompting
- [ ] Can recover from upset within a reasonable time (varies by child)
- [ ] Can wait briefly for something they want (even 30 seconds)

### How to Teach It

**Identify Their Warning Signs**
Every child has them:
- Stimming increases
- Facial expression changes
- Body tension
- Verbal changes (louder, quieter, repetitive)
- Seeking certain sensory input

Learn YOUR child's signs. Intervene EARLY.

**Build a Calming Toolkit**
Not during a meltdown - practice when CALM:
- Deep breaths (blow bubbles, blow pinwheel)
- Squeeze ball or fidget
- Weighted blanket or pressure
- Quiet space
- Favorite calming video/music
- Movement break

**Practice Waiting**
- Start with 5 seconds
- Visual timer helps
- "First wait, then cookie"
- Gradually increase
- Praise the waiting, not just the end

**During Meltdowns**
- Safety first
- Minimal words
- Offer (don't force) calming tools
- Don't try to teach during meltdown
- Process AFTER they're calm

## Skill #5: Foundational Independence

### Why It Matters
Schools have ratios. There are 20+ kids and 1-3 adults. Your child must be able to:
- Manage basic self-care (or clearly communicate needs)
- Function without constant 1:1 attention
- Separate from you

### What This Looks Like
- [ ] Toilet trained OR can clearly communicate bathroom needs
- [ ] Can eat provided food (doesn't need special preparation)
- [ ] Can separate from parent without extreme distress
- [ ] Can sit at a table/desk for short periods
- [ ] Can engage with a toy/activity independently for a few minutes
- [ ] Can be in a room with other children without constant crisis

### How to Teach It

**Toileting**
This is the #1 issue I see. Schools CAN handle accidents, but:
- A child who cannot communicate bathroom needs will struggle
- A child with no bladder awareness needs more support than most classrooms can provide
- Work on this AT HOME, intensively, before expecting school to "fix it"

**Independent Play**
- Start with 30 seconds of independent play
- Gradually increase
- Stay nearby but not engaged
- Praise independent moments: "Great playing by yourself!"

**Separation**
- Practice short separations
- Consistent goodbye routine
- Don't sneak out - say goodbye
- Start with trusted people, brief times
- Gradually increase duration and newness

**Being Part of a Group**
- Playdates with supervision
- Library story time
- Sunday school or community activities
- Practice being in a space with other children

## The Honest Conversation

### What Schools CAN Do:
- Provide specially designed instruction
- Modify curriculum and expectations
- Provide therapies (speech, OT, etc.)
- Offer accommodations
- Work on academic and social skills
- Support skill generalization

### What Schools CANNOT Do:
- Replace parenting
- Provide 24/7 1:1 attention
- Teach foundational skills that require home consistency
- Guarantee specific outcomes
- Fix everything in 6 hours a day, 180 days a year

### The Math That Matters:
- School: ~6 hours/day, 180 days/year = 1,080 hours
- Home: ~10 waking hours/day, 365 days = 3,650 hours
- **Home has 3x more teaching time**

## Your Action Plan

### This Week:
1. Complete the assessment checklist honestly
2. Identify your child's 2-3 LOWEST skills
3. Choose ONE skill to focus on intensively

### This Month:
1. Practice your chosen skill 10+ times daily
2. Involve all caregivers in consistent approach
3. Track progress (even small wins count)
4. Add a second skill when you see progress

### Before the Next IEP:
1. Document your home work on these skills
2. Share your progress with the school team
3. Ask how school can reinforce what you're teaching
4. Set realistic goals together

## Remember

You are your child's first and most important teacher.

The skills you teach at home create the foundation for everything school tries to build.

This is hard work. But it's the work that matters most.

You've got this.
