# The 5 Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me
## Quick Reference Card for Parents

---

## #1: School Cannot Replace What You Teach at Home

**The Reality:**
- School = 1,080 hours/year
- Home = 3,650+ hours/year
- You have 3x more teaching time

**What This Means:**
Your child needs foundational skills BEFORE school can be effective:
- Communicating basic needs (bathroom, help, break)
- Saying "no" and setting boundaries
- Following simple directions
- Basic self-regulation
- Minimum independence skills

**Your Job:** Teach these at home. Relentlessly. Daily.

## #2: 1:1 Support Isn't Always the Answer

**What Parents Think:** "My child needs one-on-one attention to succeed."

**The Reality:**
- 1:1 aides can create DEPENDENCY
- Children need to learn from PEERS
- Independence is the goal, not constant support
- "Least restrictive environment" exists for a reason

**Better Questions to Ask:**
- "What skills does my child need to be more independent?"
- "How can we FADE supports over time?"
- "What are peers modeling for my child?"

## #3: "Appropriate" Doesn't Mean "Optimal"

**The Law Says:** Schools must provide a "Free Appropriate Public Education" (FAPE)

**What "Appropriate" Means:**
- Reasonably calculated to enable progress
- Individualized to your child's needs
- NOT the best possible education
- NOT everything you might want

**What This Means for You:**
- You can't demand "the best" - only "appropriate"
- Focus on whether your child is making PROGRESS
- Document when progress ISN'T happening
- That's when you have a case

## #4: Behavior Is Communication

**When Your Child "Acts Out," They're Saying:**
- "This is too hard"
- "I don't understand"
- "I'm overwhelmed"
- "I need attention"
- "I want to escape this"
- "I need something and can't tell you"

**Your Job:**
- Figure out WHAT they're communicating
- Teach them a BETTER way to communicate it
- Change the environment if needed
- Don't just punish the behavior

**The ABC Model:**
- **A**ntecedent: What happened right before?
- **B**ehavior: What exactly did they do?
- **C**onsequence: What happened right after?

Understanding this = understanding your child.

## #5: You and the School Are on the Same Team

**The Adversarial Approach:**
- "Us vs. Them" mentality
- Fighting for every service
- Assuming bad intent
- Threatening due process

**The Result:** Burned bridges, exhausted parents, stressed child

**The Partnership Approach:**
- Assume good intent (until proven otherwise)
- Ask questions before accusing
- Bring solutions, not just problems
- Build relationships with the team
- Save the fight for when it really matters

**The Truth:** Most educators WANT to help your child. They're limited by resources, training, and time - not by caring.

## Bonus: Questions That Change the Conversation

### Instead of Demanding, Ask:
- "What does my child need to be more successful here?"
- "What are you seeing that I should work on at home?"
- "What would make your job easier with my child?"
- "How can we work together on this?"

### When You Disagree, Say:
- "Help me understand why you're recommending this."
- "What data are you using to make this decision?"
- "Can we try it a different way for 6 weeks and collect data?"
- "I'd like this concern documented in writing."

### When You're Frustrated, Remember:
- Take a breath before responding
- Ask for a break if needed
- Request things in writing
- You can always reconvene later
